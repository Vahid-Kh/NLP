Although not as exciting, the ultimate truth is: the sun is white; its spectrum peaks in the violet in wavelength space, in the infrared in frequency space, and in the green according to the wavelength-space blackbody approximation. Atmospheric window:A range of wavelengths over which there is relatively little absorption of radiation by atmospheric gases. The major windows are the visible window, from ∼0.3 to ∼0.9 μm; the infrared window, from ∼8 to ∼13 μm; The infrared window loses much of its transparency under very humid conditions due to continuum absorption by water vapor, and can become completely opaque when clouds are present.

In a populous area at sea level, we have achieved an average temperature reduction of 37  C from the ambient air temperature through a 24-h day–night cycle, with a maximal reduction of 42  C that occurs when the experimental set-up enclosing the emitter is exposed to peak solar irradiance. § § § A § (a) Energy balance applied to the radiative emitter (dashed line). The net flux (Qnet) is determined by the outgoing flux from the emission of the sample (Qsample), and the two incoming fluxes from the emission of the atmosphere (Qatm) and the parasitic heat losses (Qparasitic) characterized by a heat transfer coefficient h. (b) Three emitters are considered: a black emitter (black line), a near-ideal selective emitter (green line) and the actual selective emitter (blue line in Fig. 3b) of this work. (c) Net flux (Qnet) as a function of the temperature of the sample (Tsample). Note that the calculation is based on a typical atmospheric transmittance at Stanford in winter (grey line in Fig. 3b). The key parameter is the steady-state temperature corresponding to Qnet=0. The analysis highlights the two key ingredients to achieve large temperature reduction below ambient: selectivity of the emitter and minimization of the parasitic heat loss. The performance of the actual selective emitter (blue) designed and tested in this work is also predicted. With vacuum chamber and optimized | (a) Schematic of the experimental set-up. The key feature is to minimize parasitic heat losses of convection and air conduction using a vacuum system. Radiation shields and long-hollow ceramic pegs are exploited to further reduce the radiation and conduction losses through the backside of the selective emitter. The shinny sun-shade and mirror-cone are used to minimize solar irradiance. ZnSe is selected for its transparency in the mid-infrared wavelength range (red line in Fig. 3b). (b) In situ experimental set-up. (c) Details of the vacuum chamber, including the selective emitter and the ZnSe window. (a) Cross-sectional scanning electron microscope image. (b) Spectral emissivity of the selective emitter (blue), measured using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and averaged over both polarizations, aligns very well with the atmospheric transmittance (grey). The ZnSe window (red) also confirmed to be transparent throughout the atmospheric transparency window. For clarity, here only show results along normal direction. (a) Large temperature reduction below ambient through radiative cooling in a 24-h day–night cycle. After pumping down to 10−5 Torr, the selective emitter rapidly cools down to ∼40 °C below ambient temperature within half hour. A maximal cooling of 42.2 °C synchronizes with the peak of the solar irradiance, confirming the function of the sun-shade and the mirror-cone (Fig. 2), and also highlighting the high contrast between the ambient temperature and the dew point during this period. (b) Comparison with theoretical models: temperature reduction, ΔT, as a function of dew point, with the ambient temperature fixed at Tambient=16±1 °C. (c) ΔT as a function of ambient temperature, with the dew point fixed at Tdew-point=3±1 °C. Shaded areas, grey for near-black emitter and blue for selective emitter, represent the uncertainties of the model resulting from the uncertainties in estimating the parasitic heat losses and the absorption of the diffuse solar irradiance (for details, see Supplementary Notes 1 and 5). The error bar represents a conservative estimate on the sensitivity of our K-type thermocouples and the uncertainty in interpolating the dew point from a weather station at Stanford. Results in (b,c) underline a guideline to achieve large temperature reduction through radiative cooling: selective emitter with low dew point and high ambient temperature.

[Fact!] • IEA: On top of that, higher outdoor temperatures will result in reduced efficiency of cooling equipment (see below). The net result of this urban heat factor is likely to play a major role in pushing up cooling use [Fact!] • According to projections, the urban share of the world population will grow to 6.419 billion (68%) by 2050 [Projection] • •  The current dissipation of heat to ambient create positive feedback loop leading to heat islands. Potential Radiative Cooler vs. Solar PV It can already at this stage beats solar panels in performance : Solar PV : Solar PV under 5 eq hours/day  gives: 36W [Fact!][Theoretical calculations] Example : Berlin as the location(Solar Atlas data), 25% Efficiency for PV module Global tilted irradiation at optimum angle = 4525.8 MJ/m2 Power of radiation then becomes = 4525e6/(36*24*3600) = 143.48 W/m2 Power converted to electricity(eta= 0.25) = 143.48 * 0.25 = 35.87 W/m2 (all year round average) Radiative cooling: Compared to more than 100W radiative cooling [Claim!] vs. Data center energy saving from SkyCool in California = 1036 kWH/m2/year [Claim!] Total irradiation at optimum angle in Berling 1272 kWh/m2/year [Fact!] If claims are true, then this panels beat solar panel in effectiveness for refrigeration application:  1- They run 24-7 all year & can contribute grid peak shaving 2- Gives more energy saving compared to PV at a lower cost [Insight!] Global Solar Atlas Definitions Atmospheric window cooling • https://www.learnpick.in/userfiles/resources_conversion_files/presentation_statistical6-planck_radiation_formula_1517247626_277498-6.jpg Unfortunately, "The sun is Green!" makes for more exciting headlines than, "The sun is white and would peak in the green if it were a perfect blackbody and if you measure in wavelength space." Although not as exciting, the ultimate truth is: the sun is white; its spectrum peaks in the violet in wavelength space, in the infrared in frequency space, and in the green according to the wavelength-space blackbody approximation. Atmospheric window:A range of wavelengths over which there is relatively little absorption of radiation by atmospheric gases. The major windows are the visible window, from ∼0.3 to ∼0.9 μm; the infrared window, from ∼8 to ∼13 μm; The infrared window loses much of its transparency under very humid conditions due to continuum absorption by water vapor, and can become completely opaque when clouds are present.
